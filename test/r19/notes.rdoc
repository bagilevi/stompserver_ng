# = Ruby 1.9.x Testing Activities Log
#
# The reader should absorb this sequentially.  The text is a rough 
# chronological depiction of events for these activities.
#
# == Assumptions
#
# * $PH=project_home_directory
# * Commands are issued from the project home directory
# * No attempt is made to support 'tesly' functionality
#
# == Server Start
#
# * Modify $PH/test/r191/runserver.sh as required
# * ./test/r19/runserver.sh
#
# == Verify/Deny Existing Tests Functionality
#
# Verify/deny that the existing tests run.  These are:
#
# === $PH/test/test_queue_manager.rb
#
# To execute:
#
# * ./test/r19/runtest test/test_queue_manager.rb
#
# === $PH/test/test_stomp_frame.rb
#
# To execute:
#
# * ./test/r19/runtest test/test_stomp_frame.rb
#
# === $PH/test/test_topic_manager.rb
#
# To execute:
#
# * ./test/r19/runtest test/test_topic_manager.rb
#
# === Results
#
# Note: first verify that these actually run under 
# ruby 1.8.7 (2009-06-12 patchlevel 174) [i486-linux].  They do.
#
# All three of these tests encountered errors with 
# ruby 1.9.1p243 (2009-07-16 revision 24175) [i486-linux].
#
# * test_queue_manager.rb
# ** TypeError: can't convert Fixnum into String
# ** lib/stomp_server/stomp_frame.rb:13:in `include?'
# * test_stomp_frame.rb
# ** TypeError: type mismatch: Fixnum given
# ** lib/stomp_server/stomp_frame.rb:54:in `index'
# * test_topic_manager.rb
# ** test_sendmsg(TestTopics):
# ** ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)
#
# === Fixes
#
# <b>test_queue_manager</b>
#
# * Added logging to the test
# * To Be Completed
#
# <b>test_stomp_frame</b>
#
# * Added logging to the test
# * To Be Completed
#
# <b>test_topic_manager</b>
#
# * Added logging to the test
# * Remove unused and unrequired method parameter
#
# -----
#
# During the attempt to add robust logging to the server code, it was 
# eventaully recognized that:
#
# * the existing tests do not even requirea stompserver to be running
# * some experimental but sound logging code broke existing tests with ruby 1.8
#
# Why the breakage?  Because the existing tests do not use a running server,
# instead including portions of server code.
#
# This leads to the following sections.
#
# = Logging Using Standard Ruby 'logger'
#
# Initial attempts to implement this across the framework broke horribly.
# Additionally, even the existing tests failed under ruby 1.8.
#
# The initial goal of this phase was to execute the existing tests with:
#
# * Initial changes to the framework required for adding logging.
# * Successful test execution under ruby 1.8.
#
# This phase of changes was eventually completed.
